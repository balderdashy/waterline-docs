<!-- ## Ignored Properties

If you want to build custom functionality on top of Waterline models and you need to define custom model attribute properties, the Waterline validations will probably throw an error. If you know what you're doing, you can tell Waterline to ignore certain properties and not run validations for them (so this is different from custom validations).

Example model:
```javascript
attributes: {
  email: {
    type: 'email',
    special: true // ignored by validation
  },
  cousins: {
    collection: 'related',
    via: 'property',
    async: true // ignored by validation
  }
}
``` -->
