# Waterline Associations

With Waterline you can associate models with other models across all datastores. This means that
your users can live in PostgreSQL and their photos can live in MongoDB and you can interact with
the data as if they lived together on the same database. You can also have associations that
live on separate connections or in different databases within the same adapter.

The following guides will walk you through the various ways that your data can be associated and
how to setup and query associated data.
