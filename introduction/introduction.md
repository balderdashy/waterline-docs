# Waterline

Waterline provides an abstraction layer on top of your datastore, giving you easy access to query
and manipulate your data. It's an ORM (Object-Relational-Mapper) which is datastore agnostic using
adapters to communicate with your favorite datastore.

It is written entirely in Javascript and runs on Node.js.
